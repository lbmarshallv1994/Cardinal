Consistent Ordering for Carousels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Carousel ordering is now stable and predictable:

 * Newly Cataloged Item and Newest Items by Shelving Location carousels are ordered from most recently cataloged to least recently cataloged.
 * Recently Returned Item carousels is ordered is from most recently returned to least recently returned.
 * Top Circulated Items carousels is ordered is from most circulated to least circulated.
 * Manual carousels (as of now, without the ability to adjust the Position of items) are in the order they are added to the backing bucket.
  ** Emptying and refilling the bucket allows reordering.
